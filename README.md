# Spotit - Where Data Meets Music

![Spotit Logo](assets/logo.jpeg)

## Introduction - Project Goals

This project aims to identify the key factors that influence a songâ€™s popularity on Spotify. Specifically, **we aim to predict a track's popularity score** based on its general attributes, such as release year, genre, artist etc., as well as its technical features, like tempo, acousticness, loudness, and other audio characteristics.

### How Does It Work?

Using the [Spotify Songs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs?select=spotify_songs.csv), which contains data extracted from the Spotify API, we trained a machine learning model to predict a track's popularity based on its features.

However, we did not rely solely on raw data for model training. This document summarizes the techniques we employed to process and enhance the data for optimal model performance:

* **Data Cleaning**: Outliers, missing values, and duplicate entries were addressed to create a reliable dataset.
* **Feature Engineering**: We analyzed trends and correlations between track popularity and its features, generating new insights and additional data columns.
* **Feature Selection**: To prevent overfitting, we carefully selected the most relevant features for model training.
* **Model Evaluation**: Various regression models were tested, and their performance was compared using multiple metrics. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to optimize the chosen model.

### Potential Users of This Model

This system offers value to multiple stakeholders in the music industry, including:

* **Artists & Producers**: Gain insights to optimize song characteristics for better audience engagement.
* **Record Labels & Marketers**: Use predictions to inform promotional strategies and identify tracks with high potential.
* **Streaming Platforms**: Enhance recommendation algorithms by incorporating predicted popularity scores.

#### Model Deployment

The machine learning model will be deployed as a web-based application using frameworks such as [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/). Users will be able to input song attributes and receive a predicted popularity score.

Additionally, the model can be integrated into existing analytics platforms for music producers, record labels, and streaming services. Deployment options include cloud-based hosting solutions (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) to ensure scalability and global accessibility.
